            <p>The United States of America contains 50 states and reaches from ocean to ocean at each of its sides, along with a state bordering Canada to the north and an island in the Atlantic to the mainland's west. There are many things to be proud of, including the foundation of the LDS church, and the right to freedom of religion. </p>
